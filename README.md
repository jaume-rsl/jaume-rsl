### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **digital transformation** and **data analysis**, mainly focused on logistics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new things, right now I'm upskilling in Python and Azure, as key skills for my data analyst career.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for any advice that can make me a super data analyst.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you want. I'm a white belt on everything, but I know enough of quite a lot of things to get you pointed either in the right direction, or to a creative solution. "I don't know, but..." is my most common answer.
